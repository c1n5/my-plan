# Multi-Agent System (MAS) for Weekly Shopping List Creation

### Purpose:
The MAS aims to help users generate a weekly shopping list by providing varied meal options (breakfast, lunch, dinner) for two people. Each agent has clearly defined tasks and works collaboratively to deliver a tailored plan.

## 1. **Analyst Agent**
### Role:
Defines the problem by gathering and analyzing user requirements to set the foundation for the system.

### Tasks:
1. **Requirement Gathering:**
   - Conduct a user survey or questionnaire to collect preferences, including:
     - Dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, allergens).
     - Preferred cuisines (e.g., Italian, Indian, Mediterranean).
     - Time available for meal preparation (e.g., quick meals, elaborate dishes).
     - Ingredient preferences (e.g., organic, local produce).
     - Budget constraints for groceries.

2. **Meal Planning Analysis:**
   - Categorize meals into breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - Calculate portion sizes for two people per meal.
   - Identify variety requirements (e.g., no repeated meals within the week).

3. **Output Refinement:**
   - Validate gathered inputs to ensure completeness.
   - Flag potential conflicts (e.g., low budget vs. organic preferences).

### Output Deliverables:
- A detailed **User Profile** including preferences, dietary needs, budget, and meal categories.
- A **Meal Planning Outline** indicating the number of meals needed per type (breakfast, lunch, dinner) for the week.

## 2. **Researcher Agent**
### Role:
Gathers detailed information, including recipes, ingredient lists, and nutritional data, based on the Analyst Agent's outline.

### Tasks:
1. **Recipe Collection:**
   - Search databases or APIs (e.g., recipe websites) for recipes matching user preferences.
   - Ensure a diverse selection of meals per type (breakfast, lunch, dinner).
   - Gather preparation times for each recipe.

2. **Ingredient Analysis:**
   - Extract ingredient lists for each recipe.
   - Match ingredients with dietary restrictions and preferences.
   - Ensure availability of ingredients in local markets or online stores.

3. **Nutritional and Budget Information:**
   - Analyze the nutritional content of recipes (calories, protein, carbs, fats).
   - Check cost estimates for ingredients to ensure budget alignment.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Flag common ingredients across recipes to minimize waste.
   - Recommend alternatives for expensive or unavailable items.

### Output Deliverables:
- A **Recipe List** for the week, categorized by meal type.
- **Ingredient Breakdown**, listing quantities and nutritional values.
- A **Preliminary Budget** for the grocery list.

## 3. **Summary Agent**
### Role:
Synthesizes data from the Analyst and Researcher agents into a cohesive meal plan and shopping list.

### Tasks:
1. **Meal Plan Construction:**
   - Allocate recipes to specific days of the week.
   - Ensure a variety of cuisines and preparation methods across the week.
   - Adjust recipes based on portion sizes for two people.

2. **Shopping List Generation:**
   - Compile a consolidated shopping list based on recipe requirements.
   - Group items by category (e.g., vegetables, dairy, grains) for easier shopping.
   - Highlight reusable ingredients across multiple meals.

3. **Optimization and Validation:**
   - Identify ingredients that can be prepared in advance (e.g., pre-chopped vegetables).
   - Reduce redundancy in the shopping list to minimize waste and cost.
   - Cross-check the plan with the user’s dietary restrictions and budget.

### Output Deliverables:
- A **Weekly Meal Plan** with specific meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- A categorized **Shopping List** with quantities for each ingredient.
- Recommendations for ingredient substitutions to enhance cost-efficiency.

### Tasks:
1. **Presentation of Findings:**

     - Preparation time for each recipe.
     - Ingredient availability and alignment with preferences.
   - Ensure the shopping list meets the user’s budget constraints.

3. **User Feedback and Adjustments:**
   - Collect feedback on the proposed meal plan (e.g., preferences for specific meals or changes to ingredients).
   - Suggest adjustments, such as alternative recipes or budget-friendly substitutes.

4. **Final Recommendations:**
